# Implemented-BigInt-CPP-Library

## Overview
BigInt is a header-only C++ library that provides arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, allowing users to perform arithmetic operations on integers of practically unlimited size. This library is designed to be easy to use, efficient, and suitable for a wide range of applications where standard integer types are insufficient due to their limited range.
### Creating a BigInt library for C++ would offer several benefits:

--> Simplicity: Developers won't have to reinvent the wheel for handling large integers, simplifying code and reducing potential bugs.
--> Portability: Having a standardized BigInt library would ensure compatibility across different platforms and environments.
--> Performance: While performance might not match low-level C++ operations, a well-designed BigInt library can still provide acceptable performance for many use cases.
--> Applications: A BigInt library would be invaluable for cryptography, big data processing, numerical simulations, and any other application requiring precise arithmetic with large integers.

## Functionalities


## Features
1) Arbitrary Precision: Perform arithmetic operations on integers of any size, limited only by available memory.
2) Header-Only: No need for compilation or linking; simply include the header file in your project to start using BigInt.
3) Efficient: Optimized algorithms for arithmetic operations to ensure high performance.
4) Intuitive Interface: Simple and intuitive interface similar to built-in integer types in C++, making it easy to integrate BigInt into existing codebases.
5) Tested: Thoroughly tested with a comprehensive suite of test cases to ensure correctness and reliability.

## Installation
To use BigInt Library in your project, simply download the "bigint.h" header file from this GitHub repository and include it in your project. No additional installation steps are required.
Make sure to add a valid relative path in the include statement.
